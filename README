Trying to create a better alternative to logcheck.

For now, this will run in much the same way as logcheck, operating
on input from logtail.

One thing we may want to do is keep track of how long a thing has
been an issue before reporting on it. For example, if MySQL
replication goes down at 8pm, we might not care until it's been down
for four hours. If we are operating purely on input from logtail, we
will have to keep a separate state database to track this kind of
thing. That may be an issue for the future.
